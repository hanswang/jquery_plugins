# okCycle

*Tiny, modular, flexible slideshow* 

okCycle is an slideshow UI focused on modularity and ease of customization.
While I hate to reinvent the wheel for the Nth time, there are too many bloated
(but pretty!), spaghetti-code slideshows that only work well enough until you
step off their "golden path" and actually try to adapt it to your needs. What I
needed was a small plugin, with sensible defaults, that was easy customize. 

This is that.

## Usage

    $("#my_slideshow").okCycle();

### okCycle is made up of three components:

* *core* - Supplies the core functionality of the plugin. This is all you really need, but it doesn't do anything by itself.

* *transitions* - How we get from one slide to the next

* *ui* - Add useful things like, you know, user controls.

See each file for information on how to extend and write your own transitions/user interface elements.

## Dependencies

 * jQuery imagesLoaded 

The image load event is an unreliable, and tricky beast. imagesLoaded paves over some of the quirks.

## Options

option           | default                | description
---------------- | ---------------------- | -------------
effect           | 'scroll',              | Transition effect used to cycle elements
easing           | 'swing',               | Easing used by the effect
ui               | [],                    | Any UI elements that we should build
duration         | 2000,                  | Time between animations
speed            | 500,                   | Speed the slides are transitioned between
preload          | 1                      | Number of images to load (Use 0 for all) before the plugin is initialized
loadOnShow       | false                  | If true, successive images will not be loaded until they become visible
inGroupsOf       | 1                      | How manu items should we page through at a time. Currently only applicable to the 'scroll' transition
autoplay         | false,                 | Whether to start cycling immediately
afterSetup       | Function               | Called with the slideshow as 'this' immediately after setup is performed
beforeMove       | Function(transition)   | Called before moving to another slide, with the slideshow as 'this'
afterMove        | Function(transition)   | Called after moving to another slide, with the slideshow as 'this'
hoverBehavior    | Function               | During autoplay, we'll generally want to pause the slideshow. Default behavior is to pause when hovering over the slideshow element or the ui container (".okCycle-ui") if it exists

## FAQ

* I want to use native CSS3 transitions rather than animation. 

  I suggest using the [jquery.transit plugin](https://github.com/rstacruz/jquery.transit). 
  In the okCycle.transitions file, replace the calls to animate with transit.

* I want to control slideshows manually

  Since okCycle can potentially be bound to multiple DOM elements, you need to pass in the
  jQuery extended DOM element that you want to control. If the element is omitted it
  will default to the first bound element (which may suffice if one only exists).

      var slideshows = $(".slideshows").okCycle();

      slideshow.next(slideshows.eq(0));

## Notes

* Has been tested on jQuery 1.6.2 and higher

* As of version okCycle v1.2, jQuery v1.5 or higher is REQUIRED and >= v1.7 is SUGGESTED

* Although okCycle implements an autoplaying feature, as controls can exist anywhere on
  page, it may be necessary to rewrite the hoverBehavior function to take into
  account the position of your slideshow controls
